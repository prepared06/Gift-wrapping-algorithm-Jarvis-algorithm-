# Gift-wrapping-algorithm-Jarvis-algorithm-
It is my individual work from discipline computer graphics. Here the Jarvis algorithm
on C ++ is implemented with the use of openGL 3.3. The scene is presented in 3D dimesion
with Phong lighting model. Here I use glew, glfw3, SOIL, glm and some code in such files 
"ReadShaders.h", "FPSCamera.h" from this nice tutorials https://learnopengl.com/
